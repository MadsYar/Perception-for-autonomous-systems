    "## Implementation of global registration \n",
    "### Task 1\n",
    "Today, your task is to implement a global registration algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be able to roughly align two point clouds.\n",
    "Implement the global registration, and then try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can you fit `r1.pcd` and `r2.pcd`?\n",
    "2. Can you fit `car1.ply` and `car2.ply`?\n",
    "The corresponding files are in the `global_registration` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2 (Challange)\n",
    "Challanges attempt either or both:\n",
    "- Implement local registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attempt to reconstruct the car from the images in `car_challange` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the notebooks from Monday as a starting point."
